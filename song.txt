Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right

Saying, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right

Rise up this morning
Smile with the rising sun
Three little birds
Pitched by my doorstep
Singing sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Sayin': This is my message to you

Saying, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right

Saying, don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing
Gonna be all right
hi
